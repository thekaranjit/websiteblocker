# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one 
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual 
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.             
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#       127.0.0.1       localhost  
#       ::1             localhost
